## Welcome to the Blug

Here we are. My first blug. I should have done this a long time ago. For anyone who is reading this far into the future, 
I'm Steins;trait, the renowned genius polymath polysci polyglot doctor. The one thing I am not right now, though, is a polydev.
This is unacceptable to me. How can I be a man of many talents if I am missing one of the most fundamental talents needed to
navigate my current world? Absolutely unacceptable, I should have learned all important coding languages years and years ago. 
But as they say, the best time to plant a tree is 25 years ago, the second best time is right now. So here I am, and here I go.
